So its been now a full three months of being a web developer and im absolutely loving it. Such a massive career change for me and i haven’t regretted it. I’ve gone from lowly customer service agent “hello how can i help today?” to web developer “I can build this and style it for you”.
Being proud of myself is an understatement and i thought id share my experience of the last three months.

As like my previous article the first few weeks if being a web developer were getting attuned to my new environment and also getting my working environment setup. This was daunting as i haven’t setup a development environment before. Luckily i had a setup guide kindly provided by my employer, which i could share in another article.

Learning as a junior is great when you are coding on a daily basis for works. I recommend to anyone learning to code as much as possible as in this line of work your are always learning by doing. Google is your best friend when it comes to problem solving and stack overflow too. Initially i was working on projects that already been built and needs css tweaking and styling amends to the designs created by the design teams. Making sure projects are pixel perfect is something i’d never come across but useful google chrome plugins help to have measuring tools to make sure containers and divs are correctly aligned and sized.

One thing i noted is that in development you have downtime between projects and this is a great time to either look back at projects the company has done to familiarise myself with best working practises and code bases used and also to learn more online. If the company is willing they will have online facilities to learn new skills or just free online courses on code academy of to test your skills in codewars.

As i was using mysql quite a bit i logged into codewars and practised mysql statements and solved test questions and i levelled up quickly!

We are always learning and take the downtime between projects to learn as much as possible as when in projects time is precious.
Apart from styling amendments i worked with mysql databases and managing these. MySQL and MsSQL is definitely worth looking in to as these skills are invaluable for a developer. The language is oretty straight forward for simple statements.

'''
SELECT * FROM database
'''

This will get all table contents from a certain named database. There are a few symbols to use but i treat MySQL as talking to someone real as you ask it something in nearly plain english and it will respond.

This easily covered two months which speeds by very quickly. In the last month i have had projects come back from clients with amends and changes which i have implemented and also i have managed my own build project and delivered it to the client.
The build was simple HTML, CSS pages, which is a great start for me as nothing to complicated. I started with the designs and looked to see how i would build the page. Planning is key. I then built to layout and filled in the content. Styling came second and that took the most time to make sure content aligned correctly to the design and making sure hover statuses and links worked. Css styling takes tike but as you do it more the quicker you get.

Hopefully this is useful to you but im just sharing my journey. I may write some articles in styling and mysql at some point so stay tuned.
Happy coding out there everyone!!
