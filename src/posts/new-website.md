So after many months of contemplating....no procrastinating i have managed to build my new website. I hope you like the new look and feel as i have used a brand new platform and language that i have been learning over the last few weeks. Gatsby!!

I found Gatsby after hearing some other developers talking about how freta it is on twitter. I mainly work with wordpress at work and the idea of a wordpress site was playing around in my mind, but i wanted something smaller than a massive CMS for creating a few pages. Wordpress seemed a bit overkill and bulky for my needs, so GAtsby turend out to be the thing i needed.

Firstly my goodness the documentation is brilliant, clear and concise for building a simple site that shows cute videos of pandas. I have previously completed an introduction course to React so the syntax and impementation was a familair site, which helped me learn a bit quicker, but the documentation is so clear not know React shouldnt turn you off form getting started with Gatsby.
