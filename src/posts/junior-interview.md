So i recently had an interview for a junior web developer role and was expecting the worst. I was expecting loads of technical questions and having to white board processes etc. And basically was bricking it before and little bit during the interview. Now this will not always be the case with all interviews, but here is my experience.

Expecting the worst i was pleasantly surprised to find that the majority of the interview was a chat about what the company does and what they are looking for and also questions about what you want and about yourself in a bit more detail. As a junior developer the company already understood i needed to learn more and wanted to mainly see what kind of person i was and if i was a good fit within the team.
I cannot stress enough to anyone that honesty in these interviews is the key if you don’t know somthing be honest and say you don’t know, but also add that you ate willing to learn and maybe take a physical note on paper of this. This shows then you are honest and have a keen interest to learn and develop as a person. Don’t lie about technical knowledge as it will always come back to bite you later on.

Take your time with your answers and its ok to ask if you can come back to the question later. Remember an interview is for the company to get to know you and also for you to get to know them. Ask them questions too as you will be working there so need to know how things operate with them too.

As i didn’t have technical questions to a harsh degree just be prepared and if in doubt again be honest and say you are unsure. Better to be upfront about something than muddling through an issue only to make it look worse.

Lastly show you are keen about tech and talk about the things you are passionate about even if its not relevant to the role talk about what you have been working on or learning.

Remember rejection can happen but always ask for feedback if it does as this can only help you grow more. Losing is sometimes winning
